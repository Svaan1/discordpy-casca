# Casca
### A simple cog structured discord bot
Casca is a simple slash command bot made using the discordpy lib, i made it for fun so it's pretty much useless, though logic can be applied and it can be used for something

### Deploying 
1. Set all the necessary environment variables:
    - Token
    - Testing Guild (Optional)
2. Just launch the app, either using the docker image or by installing everything in the requirements file and running ``main.py``
